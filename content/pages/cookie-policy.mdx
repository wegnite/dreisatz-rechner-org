# Dreisatz Rechner Cookie Policy

**Last Updated: January 16, 2025**

This Cookie Policy explains how Dreisatz Rechner ("Dreisatz Rechner", "we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar tracking technologies on [dreisatzrechner.org](https://dreisatzrechner.org) and any related products or services (collectively, the "Services"). By visiting our website or using the Dreisatz generator, you agree to the placement and use of cookies described below.

Managing cookies ensures you receive a smooth creative workflow—from saving prompt packs to exporting vintage prints—while respecting your privacy preferences.

## What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files that a website stores on your device to remember information about your visit. They allow us to:

- Keep you signed in across sessions and remember locale preferences
- Save recently generated polaroid templates, prompt packs, and export settings
- Understand how creators use the generator so we can improve features and performance
- Protect the platform against fraud, spam, and unauthorized access

## Types of Cookies We Use

### 1. Essential Cookies (Required)
These cookies power critical features of the Dreisatz Rechner platform:

- **Session & Authentication** – maintain your login state as you switch pages or revisit the generator
- **Security** – help detect malicious activity, prevent double submissions, and enforce rate limits
- **Localization** – remember language and region so content loads in your preferred locale

You cannot disable essential cookies because they ensure the Services function correctly.

### 2. Performance & Analytics Cookies (Recommended)
We use analytics cookies to understand how creators interact with our tools:

- Measure generator load times and rendering performance
- See which template packs or tutorials are popular so we can prioritize improvements
- Detect error states or crashes to quickly ship fixes

We currently use privacy-focused analytics providers that aggregate usage data. Metrics do not include prompt text or the contents of your uploaded photos.

### 3. Functional Cookies (Optional)
Functional cookies make your workflow smoother:

- Remember recently used prompts, overlays, and border styles
- Store preferred export formats (square, 3×4" print, story mode)
- Track onboarding progress so we do not repeat tutorials you have already completed

### 4. Marketing & Personalization Cookies (Optional)
We only activate marketing cookies with your consent:

- Tailor in-product announcements about new template packs or print partners
- Measure campaign performance if you arrive from an affiliate or newsletter link
- Support retargeting on platforms like Google or Meta (when enabled)

## Third-Party Cookies
Some trusted partners may set cookies when you use our Services:

- **Authentication providers** (Google, GitHub, Apple) if you sign in using a social account
- **Payment processors** (Stripe) when purchasing subscriptions or print credits
- **Customer success tools** (such as Crisp chat) if you opt into live support

Each partner operates under its own privacy policy. We only integrate providers that commit to GDPR- and CCPA-compliant practices.

## How to Manage Cookies

You remain in control of your preferences:

- Adjust cookie settings directly in our on-site Cookie Preference Center (available in the footer)
- Change browser settings to block or delete cookies (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge all provide cookie controls)
- Use private browsing or incognito modes to limit persistent storage

If you disable essential cookies, core features—such as logging in, saving templates, or exporting creations—may no longer function.

## Do Not Track Signals

Some browsers offer a "Do Not Track" (DNT) setting. While we currently do not respond to DNT signals, you can rely on the consent controls described above to manage cookies.

## Updates to This Policy

We may update this Cookie Policy to reflect new features, legal requirements, or feedback from the community. When we make material changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date and provide notice via email or in-app notifications.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions about our use of cookies, please contact us at [support@dreisatzrechner.org](mailto:support@dreisatzrechner.org).

We appreciate your trust as you create and share nostalgic stories with Dreisatz Rechner.
