# Dreisatz Rechner Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 16, 2025**

Dreisatz Rechner ("Dreisatz Rechner", "we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy and giving you control over your creative data. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect when you use [dreisatzrechner.org](https://dreisatzrechner.org), why we collect it, how we use it, and the rights you have.

By accessing the site, creating an account, or using the Dreisatz generator (together, the "Services"), you consent to the practices described here.

## Information We Collect

### 1. Information You Provide
- **Account details** – name or display name, email address, password (hashed).
- **Profile preferences** – locale, interface theme, preferred export formats, saved prompt packs.
- **Uploads** – photos you submit for AI rendering, captions, and custom prompts.
- **Billing information** – if you purchase a subscription or credits through Stripe, we receive limited billing metadata (billing country, last 4 digits, expiration) but never store full payment card numbers.

### 2. Automatically Collected Data
- **Usage data** – actions taken in the generator, template packs viewed, export success status.
- **Device & technical data** – browser type, operating system, screen resolution, language, referrer URL.
- **Log information** – IP address (anonymized where legally required), user agent, timestamps, error traces.

### 3. Data from Integrations
If you connect third-party services (e.g., Google for login), we receive only the information necessary to authenticate you—typically your name, avatar, and verified email.

## How We Use Your Information

We process your information to:

- Provide, personalize, and improve the Dreisatz generator and templates
- Save your creative preferences and session history
- Respond to support requests and communicate service updates
- Analyze aggregated usage patterns to optimize performance and prevent abuse
- Process payments, manage subscriptions, and comply with accounting obligations

We do **not** sell your personal data. We do not use your uploaded photos to train third-party models without explicit consent.

## Legal Bases for Processing (EEA/UK Users)

When applicable laws require a legal basis, we rely on:

- **Contractual necessity** – to provide the Services you request
- **Legitimate interest** – to secure the platform, measure performance, and develop new features
- **Consent** – for optional cookies, marketing communications, and beta experiments
- **Legal obligation** – to comply with tax, accounting, or regulatory requirements

## Data Retention

- Uploaded photos and generated images are stored for up to 72 hours by default, after which they are automatically deleted unless you choose to save them to a personal collection.
- Account profile data is retained while your account remains active. You may request deletion at any time.
- Billing records are retained for the period required by tax and financial regulations (typically 7 years).

## How We Share Information

We share personal data with trusted service providers who help us operate the platform, such as:

- Cloud hosting, storage, and CDN providers
- Authentication providers (Google, GitHub, Apple)
- Payment processors (Stripe)
- Analytics and product tooling (privacy-centric platforms)
- Customer support and communication tools

All vendors are bound by confidentiality obligations and may only process data on our instructions.

We may disclose information if required by law, to respond to lawful requests, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Dreisatz Rechner, our users, or the public.

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have the right to:

- Access, correct, or delete personal data we hold about you
- Export your data in a portable format
- Object to or restrict certain processing activities
- Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent

Submit requests at [support@dreisatzrechner.org](mailto:support@dreisatzrechner.org). We will respond within the timelines required by applicable law.

## Security

We implement industry-standard security measures, including encryption in transit, access controls, audit logging, and regular vulnerability assessments. While no system is 100% secure, we continuously monitor and improve our safeguards.

## International Data Transfers

Dreisatz Rechner may store or process data in the United States and other countries. When we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland to jurisdictions without equivalent protections, we rely on Standard Contractual Clauses or other approved safeguards.

## Children's Privacy

Our Services are not directed to children under 13 (or the equivalent age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us and we will take appropriate steps to remove the data.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be posted on this page with a new "Last Updated" date, and we may notify you via email or in-app messages.
