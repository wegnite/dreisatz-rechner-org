# Dreisatz Rechner Terms of Service

**Last Updated: January 16, 2025**

These Terms of Service ("Terms") form a legally binding agreement between you ("you", "your") and Dreisatz Rechner ("Dreisatz Rechner", "we", "us", or "our") governing your access to and use of [dreisatzrechner.org](https://dreisatzrechner.org), the Dreisatz generator, template library, and related services (collectively, the "Services").

By creating an account, purchasing a subscription, or using the generator, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.

## 1. Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years old (or the age of digital consent in your jurisdiction) to use the Services. If you are accessing the Services on behalf of a company or organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that entity to these Terms.

## 2. Accounts

- You must provide accurate and complete information when creating an account.
- Keep your login credentials secure and notify us immediately of any unauthorized use.
- You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account.

## 3. Subscriptions and Credits

- Certain features require a paid subscription or prepaid credits. Pricing and available plans are shown at checkout and may change with notice.
- All fees are payable in advance. Unless otherwise stated, subscriptions renew automatically until canceled.
- You may cancel at any time through your account settings. Cancellation stops future charges but does not grant refunds for prior payments unless required by law.

## 4. License and Acceptable Use

We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and use the Services for personal or commercial creative projects, subject to these Terms.

You agree not to:

- Upload content that is unlawful, defamatory, hateful, or infringes third-party rights (including copyright, trademark, or publicity rights).
- Generate images that depict minors in unsafe contexts or violate platform safety guidelines.
- Reverse engineer, scrape, or resell access to the Services without written permission.
- Attempt to bypass usage limits, rate limits, or security controls.
- Use the Services to develop competing products or train competing machine-learning models.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate acceptable use.

## 5. Your Content

- You retain all rights to the photos, prompts, and other content you upload ("User Content").
- You grant us a worldwide, royalty-free license to host, process, and display User Content solely to provide the Services.
- You are responsible for obtaining permissions, releases, or licenses necessary to use third-party likenesses, logos, or materials.
- We may remove User Content that violates these Terms or applicable law.

## 6. Generated Output

Subject to your compliance with these Terms and applicable law, you own the rights to images generated by the Services. Be aware that certain jurisdictions limit the copyright status of AI-generated works; you are solely responsible for assessing how you may use output.

## 7. Intellectual Property

The Services, including software, interfaces, prompts, brand elements, and template designs, are owned by Dreisatz Rechner or our licensors. You may not copy, modify, or create derivative works of the Services without written permission.

## 8. Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. Our collection and use of personal data are described in the [Privacy Policy](/privacy). By using the Services, you consent to those practices.

## 9. Third-Party Services

The Services integrate with third-party tools (e.g., authentication providers, payment processors). We are not responsible for third-party terms or content. Your use of third-party services is at your own risk and may be governed by separate agreements.

## 10. Termination

We may suspend or terminate access to the Services at any time if you violate these Terms or if necessary to protect the platform or other users. You may close your account at any time via settings or by contacting support.

Upon termination, your license to use the Services ends and we may delete your User Content from active systems, subject to legal retention requirements.

## 11. Disclaimers

The Services are provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation.

## 12. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Dreisatz Rechner and its affiliates are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or lost profits arising from your use of the Services. Our total liability for any claim is limited to the amount you paid for the Services during the 12 months preceding the event giving rise to liability.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so the above may not fully apply to you.

## 13. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Dreisatz Rechner, its affiliates, and personnel from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from: (a) your use of the Services; (b) your User Content; or (c) your violation of these Terms or applicable law.

## 14. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes will be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Delaware, unless local law requires otherwise.

## 15. Changes to the Terms

We may update these Terms occasionally. If changes are material, we will provide notice (e.g., email or in-app notification) before the new Terms take effect. By continuing to use the Services after updates, you agree to the revised Terms.
